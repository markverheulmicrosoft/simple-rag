Global temperatures have risen significantly over the past century, primarily due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. This warming trend affects weather patterns, ocean levels, and ecosystems worldwide.

Renewable energy adoption is accelerating globally. Solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cost-effective alternatives to fossil fuels, helping reduce carbon emissions.

Deforestation continues to be a major concern, as forests play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Conservation efforts and sustainable forestry practices are being implemented to address this issue.

Ocean acidification, caused by rising CO2 levels, threatens marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, with potential impacts on fisheries and coastal communities.
